The moderate and aggressive profiles achieved perfect 100% extraction with no blocks, while only the naive profile had some blocks (2 out of ~8 attempts). This suggests we can safely increase throughput without triggering detection systems. Incrementally increasing concurrency from 3 to 4 and requests per minute from 40 to 50 should boost overall extraction rate while staying within safe operational parameters that have proven successful."

The naive profile performed best (50% extracted) while moderate/aggressive were completely blocked, suggesting the target is highly sensitive to automation patterns. Moving to headed mode will add browser rendering overhead but appear more human-like. Reducing concurrency from 3→2 and RPM from 40→30 decreases request velocity. Increasing jitter range to 800-3000ms creates more human-like timing variability. These conservative changes should improve stealth without drastically altering the working aspects of the current profile."
