      "reasoning": "The current configuration is performing well with 91.7% extraction rate. The moderate and aggressive profiles achieved perfect 100% extraction with no blocks, while only the naive profile had some blocks (2 out of ~8 attempts). This suggests we can safely increase throughput without triggering detection systems. Incrementally increasing concurrency from 3 to 4 and requests per minute from 40 to 50 should boost overall extraction rate while staying within safe operational parameters that have proven successful."

Since we have 0% false positives and 100% human success rate, I have significant room to be more aggressive. I'll lower the block threshold from 4.5 to 3.0 to capture more bots, and increase weights on key bot indicators like asset_warmup_missing and dwell_time_avg to better differentiate bot behavior."
